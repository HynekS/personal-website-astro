description: The basic rule of CSS animations is that you will animate only transform or opacity. But sometimes you don't want to play by the rules, and I show you how to recreate a circular reveal effect (inspired by Paul Lewis) by animating box-shadow.

This post is inspired by a  YouTube  video by [Paul Lewis](https://twitter.com/aerotwist), titled [Creating a circular reveal animation with JavaScript and CSS!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvQPkJd0gc). He is explaining how to make a cool image animation using CSS and Javascript.

Paul's approach is quite sophisticated. He is putting the image into a circular container that is a little bit smaller than the image itself. When the animation is triggered, the container is _expanding_, while the contained image is _contracting_ at the same speed. This is creating the "reveal" effect. Paul is using JavaScript and some clever math to sync the easing of the two motions. Just take a look:

<iframe
  width="560"
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YdvQPkJd0gc"
  title="YouTube video player"
  frameborder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowfullscreen
  class="w-full aspect-video"
></iframe>

The video made me wonder why Paul is using such a complex approach. Most likely because he's a decent guy who plays by the rules. And the basic rule of CSS animations is that you will animate only [transform or opacity](https://web.dev/animations-guide/) (if you are wondering why, [here is the detailed explanation](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/12/gpu-animation-doing-it-right/)).

But I am nowhere near as smart as Paul, hence I'd rather avoid such sophisticated stuff. So I decided to play dirty. Hold onto your hats‚Äîhere is a way to replicate the reveal effect using a _box shadow animation_!

First things first, the CSS:

```css
:root {
  --dimensions: 200px;
  --bgColor: white;
  --cropSize: calc(var(--dimensions) / 10);
}

.container {
  position: relative;
  height: var(--dimensions);
  width: var(--dimensions);
}

.container::after {
  content: "";
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  height: 100%;
  width: 100%;
  border-radius: 50%;
  z-index: 1;
  box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 var(--cropSize) var(--bgColor);
  transition: box-shadow 0.3s ease;
}

.container:hover::after {
  box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 0 var(--bgColor);
}

.image {
  position: absolute;

  /* We need to center the image (*inset*) and make it a little bit smaller than the container (exactly: 1 px on both sides, so 2 px in sum). If we skip this, an ugly, crispy 'halo' would appear (try it yourself). */
  inset: 1px;
  max-width: calc(100% - 2px);
  max-height: calc(100% - 2px);

  z-index: -1;
  border-radius: 50%;
}
```

And here is the markup:

```html
<div class="container">
  <img
    class="image"
    src="http://placekitten.com/300/300"
    alt="a furry qute kitt'n"
  />
</div>
```
