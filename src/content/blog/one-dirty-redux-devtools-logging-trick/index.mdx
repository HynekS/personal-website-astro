While redux is far from being the coolest kid in the playground at the moment (late 2020), I am still using it on some of my projects. There is still one feature that most of its competitors (like [zustand](https://https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand), [jotai](https://github.com/pmndrs/jotai), [recoil](https://recoiljs.org/), [react-query](https://react-query-v3.tanstack.com/) or [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/)) lack so far: mature and feature-rich devtools.

<Note>This article is not up-to-date. While the proposed trick is still valid, I can't see any reason to keep using vanilla Redux in 2022. üí° I would suggest checking out <a style={{ all: "unset", textDecoration: "underline", cursor: "pointer" }} href="https://redux-toolkit.js.org/">Redux Toolkit</a>, which yields a much better DX (unfortunately, you can't use the proposed trick here).</Note>

But even on redux-devtools, there was something that made me think, "meh‚Ä¶", and that thing is logging constants.  Even though I made my redux constants less GENERATED_CODE_LOOKALIKE and more human readable (thanks mostly to [ducks](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux) for inspiration), I'd like to be able to parametrize them.

```js
// These constants are quite pleasant to read, but they are still, well‚Ä¶ constant. 
const FETCH_PROJECTS_OF_SINGLE_YEAR_INITIALIZED = "[projects] Fetching projects of single year has started"
const FETCH_PROJECTS_OF_SINGLE_YEAR_SUCCESS = "[projects] Fetching projects of single year was successful"
const FETCH_PROJECTS_OF_SINGLE_YEAR_FAILURE = "[projects] Fetching projects of single year has failed"
```

On the devtools pane, it looks OK; not great, not terrible:

<Image src={import(`./assets/redux_devtools_00_final.png`)} alt="Image of redux devtools (neutral)"/>

However, if I dispatch a lot of these actions in a row, I can't help but think that something is missing here:

<Image src={import(`./assets/redux_devtools_01_final.png`)} alt="Image of redux devtools without parameters (not optimal result)"/>

As it turned out, it would be quite easy! Just turn your constants into functions that receive an argument and return a string utilizing it:

```js
const FETCH_PROJECTS_OF_SINGLE_YEAR_INITIALIZED = year =>
  `[projects] Fetching projects of year ${year} has started`
const FETCH_PROJECTS_OF_SINGLE_YEAR_SUCCESS = year =>
  `[projects] Fetching projects of year ${year} was successful`
const FETCH_PROJECTS_OF_SINGLE_YEAR_FAILURE =  year =>
  `[projects] Fetching projects of year ${year} has failed`
```

Well, OK, then, but what about action reducers? No worries! In the case of actions, just make their type property a function call and pass your argument in:

```js
const fetchProjectsOfSingleYearInit = year => ({
  // Note 'type' is a function call
  type: FETCH_PROJECTS_OF_SINGLE_YEAR_INITIALIZED(year),
  year,
})
const fetchProjectsOfSingleYearSuccess = (projectsOfSingleYear, year) => ({
  // Note 'type' is a function call
  type: FETCH_PROJECTS_OF_SINGLE_YEAR_SUCCESS(year),
  projectsOfSingleYear,
  year,
})
const fetchProjectsOfSingleYearFailure = (error, year) => ({
  type: FETCH_PROJECTS_OF_SINGLE_YEAR_FAILURE(year),
  error,
})
```

As for the reducers, there is the same pattern: make your case a function call and pass your argument. It will match as expected:

```js
export default function reducer(state = {}, action = {}) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case FETCH_PROJECTS_OF_SINGLE_YEAR_INITIALIZED(action.year):
      return {
        //...
      };
    case FETCH_PROJECTS_OF_SINGLE_YEAR_SUCCESS(action.year):
      return {
        //...
      };
    case FETCH_PROJECTS_OF_SINGLE_YEAR_FAILURE(action.year):
      return {
        //...
      };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```

And voil√†, your redux devtools actions console is now much more informative (and fun):

<Image src={import(`./assets/redux_devtools_02_final.png`)} alt="Image of redux devtools, parametrized"/>

I really appreciate this when debugging a lot of actions of the same type  dispatched with different parameters. More than that, it can reveal possible bugs caused by unexpected arguments passed into actions (e.g., react-router params from a mistyped url).

<Image src={import(`./assets/redux_devtools_03_final.png`)} alt="Image of redux devtools without with a lot of actions of the same type being dispatched with different parameters, parametrized"/>

The idea of making constants dynamic may sound like heresy to some hardcore Redux developers. I would argue that:

- The pattern is deterministic, with only pure functions used.
- It is meant to be used rather temporarily, for the purpose of debugging.

So far, I haven't encountered any issues using it.

üëç Enjoy!
