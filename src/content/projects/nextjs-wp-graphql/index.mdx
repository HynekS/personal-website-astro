### Comment

A new version of a legacy WordPress site for a small firm of archaeological consultants.

The backend was preserved, but it was migrated to a [Bedrock](https://roots.io/bedrock/) boilerplate. It is now being used as a "headless" CMS. The data are being served via a GraphQL api.

The frontend was built from scratch on NextJS. Styling is being done with Tailwindcss via twin.macro.
