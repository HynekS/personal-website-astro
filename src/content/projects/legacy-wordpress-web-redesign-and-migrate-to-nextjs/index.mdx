### Comment

A new version of a legacy WordPress site for a small company operating in the field of archaeology.

The backend was preserved, but it was migrated to a [Bedrock](https://roots.io/bedrock/) boilerplate. It is now being used as a "headless" CMS. The data is being served via a GraphQL api.

The frontend was redesigned and built from scratch on Next.js. Styling is being done with [twin.macro](https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.macro), a CSS-in-JS library built atop of Tailwindcss.
