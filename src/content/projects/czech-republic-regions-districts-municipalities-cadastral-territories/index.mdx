# Czech Republic regions, districts, municipalities, and cadastral territories

A project based on [public data](https://www.cuzk.cz/Katastr-nemovitosti/Poskytovani-udaju-z-KN/Ciselniky-ISKN/Ciselniky-katastralnich-uzemi-a-pracovist-resortu.aspx) provided by the [State Administration of Land Surveying and Cadastre](https://www.cuzk.cz/Uvod.aspx). The aim of the project is to get orderly source data for the administrative division of the Czech Republic.

The converted data are further used as a foundation for my custom PHP Faker plugin to generate a random location hierarchy in the shape of **Region > District > Municipality > Cadastral Territory**.
