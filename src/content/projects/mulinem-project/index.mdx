## <span class="text-lg [filter:opacity(0.8)]">âš </span> The problem

The scientific project (on which I did participate) needed a website for presentation. There was a WordPress site with a slightly modified default theme, but it wasn't really representative. Also, for a rarely updated site, it was probably unnecessary to pay for WordPress hosting.

## <span class="text-lg [filter:opacity(0.8)]">ðŸ’¡</span> The solution

Initially, I converted the site into a static one with Gatsby on the frontend and Netlify CMS on the backend. The site was OK, but the colleagues were somewhat struggling with the CMS.

 I decided to migrate it to Sanity (which I have used in the past and is more user friendly). Because Gatsby has silently passed away in the meantime, I decided to move to Next.js. I also ditched SSG in favor of SSR.

 The site is [up and running](https://mulinem.net), being hosted on Vercel.

## Comment

One thing I wasn't happy about was the frontend-to-backend type of safety. It is not officially supported yet for GROQ queries (it might work better with GraphQL). There are some promising open source projects working on solutions, but they are still in alpha, and I wasn't able to make them really work. In the end, I just used the codegen and wrote the types for API responses by hand, which is a little _meh_, but for a small project like this, probably acceptable.

In general, migrating from Gatsby to Next.js went smoothly. The result is much cleaner (which is probably due to the fact that I have more experience with Next than I did with Gatsby when building the previous version). The only thing I've struggled with a little is the different APIs, mainly for media.

During the build, I am replacing React with Preact to get smaller production bundles.
