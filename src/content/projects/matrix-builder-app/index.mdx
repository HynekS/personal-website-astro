## Why?

Because there is just one tool available for building relational matrices of archeological sites, [Stratify](http://www.stratify.org/), and it was last updated _thirteen years_ ago.

So I've decided to craft an online app to provide an alternative. It's a project with "niche SAAS" ambitionâ€”more an opportunity to learn new things than to raise money.

## Main Challenges

I've never dealt with graph data structures extensively before, so I've learned a lot of things while developing this app (e.g., what is "topological sort", "transitive reduction," and why and how to do such dark rituals).

Even after learning how to construct a graph, check for cycles, and reduce it, there is still the graphical matrix itself that needs to be built. I am currently using [Reaflow](https://reaflow.dev/), a react layer on top of [Elk.js](https://github.com/kieler/elkjs). It is a solid starter, but I'd probably need to create a fork and do some updates to compete with the features of 13-year-old Stratify. Also, the bundle size of these libs is huge (Elk has ca. 1.2M itself!).

It was also my first encounter with tRPC, which definitely has a learning curve, but once overcome, the DX is hardly comparable to whatever I've used since.


Also, I've never used Prisma extensively before. Sometimes, I've struggled quite a bit while building some queries, but the typescript definitions often helped a lot.

## My solution

My solution is still work in progress. Please, Wait for updates.
