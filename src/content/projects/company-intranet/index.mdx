## <span class="text-lg [filter:opacity(0.8)]">âš </span> The problem

One of my clients was using internal applications to manage his company's projects. I had to use this app very often due to our close cooperation.

The app was written years ago in bare PHP 5. While it mostly served its purpose, the technical debt began to show. It was often *very slow*. Rendering some pages would take almost a minute! It was also tedious to navigate, search, or filter the data.

## <span class="text-lg [filter:opacity(0.8)]">ðŸ’¡</span> The solution

I created a new version of the application with an emphasis on speed and ease of use.

## Techs I used

The front-end is a single-page app built with React. Since it's for logged-in users only, i didn't care much about SSR. The codebase was initially written in JavaScript, but I've since migrated it to TypeScript. State management is done by the Redux toolkit.

Because of the focus on speed, the code is being pretty aggressively code-splitted and preloaded. For a production build, React is being aliased to Preact, which results in a much smaller bundle size.

Styling is being done using twin.macro.

The backend is built on Laravel, which provides a robust, future-proof solution.

Because of the stack, the application is very easy to deploy. I use AWS Lightsail's VPS for hosting.
