# {frontmatter.title}

I am currently migrating my blog from Next.js to Astro. I also recently fell in love with Preact. I decided that in this new blog iteration, I will ditch React completely and I will recreate the small amount of interactive components using that great 3Kb library.

Since Astro has the 'next-gen island architecture', it is actually easy to bring any library/framework for an island component – you can have a dropdown in React, dialog in Svelte and theme toggle button as a web component. I wouldn't do _that_, but it makes decision like the above mentioned easier to make.

I write my blog posts in MDX, which is a superset of Markdown that allows (among other things) using interactive components. A code block with a button that would copy the contained snippet to a clipboard is a nice and simple example of this component.

## Install Astro and create a MDX post

If you don't have a previous experience with Astro, you can [follow this tutorial](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/0-introduction/). Of course using Markdown and MDX in Astro can be a little different than in other frameworks – if you are not sure, [check the docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/).


So let's suppose that we have Astro installed and we have a simple simple MDX  blog post with a frontmatter and code block:

````md
---
title: How to sum up two numbers in JavaScript
category: JavaScript

# How to sum up two numbers in JavaScript

Let's make a function:
```js
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b
}
```
And this is how we do it!
````

This will serve as our starting point.

## Create Preact integration

To create Preact integration, you need to basically use just one simple command:

```bash
# Using NPM
npx astro add preact
# Using Yarn
yarn astro add preact
```

However, I am using TypeScript and the default config is considering JSX as React. So I would also update the `tsconfig.json` file to prevent type errors:

```js
{
  "extends": "astro/tsconfigs/strict",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "jsx": "react-jsx",
    "jsxImportSource": "preact"
  }
}
```

As the docs suggests, you can also use pragma comment (which is handy if you are using different libraries in the same Astro project):

```jsx
/** @jsxImportSource preact */
```

## Create an enhanced `<pre>` component

In most markdown compilers, the block between the triple backticks is being converted to a `<pre>` element. So we need to enhance it.

First, let's make a file for our component in `components` folder, called `EnhancedPreElement.tsx`

```jsx
// EnhancedPreElement.tsx
import { createRef, ComponentChildren } from "preact";

const EnhancedPreElement = ({ children, ...props }: { children: ComponentChildren }) => {
  const snippetRef = createRef<HTMLPreElement>();

  const copyToClipboard = () => {
    /* This is kinda messy, but I am afraid there is currently not 
    *  a better way than creating a <textarea> element, putting the <pre>
    *  element's `innerText` in it, select it and copy it to clipboard :/
    */
    let snippet = snippetRef.current;
    let area = document.createElement("textarea");
    area.value = snippet ? snippet.innerText : "";
    area.select();
    area.setSelectionRange(0, 99999);
    navigator.clipboard.writeText(area.value);
  };

  return (
    <div className="relative group">
      <pre {...props} ref={snippetRef}>
        {children}
      </pre>
      <button
        className="text-sm text-gray-300 bg-gray-700 rounded absolute top-4 right-4 px-2 invisible group-hover:visible"
        onClick={() => {
            copyToClipboard();
          }
        }
      >
        Copy
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default EnhancedPreElement;
```
In this component, we are recreating the original code block, but we've added a wrapper including the 'copy to clipboard' button.

Note the three lines through the opening `<pre>` and closing `</pre>` tags. With `{...props}`, we are passing down all the meta parameters used in MDX (language, filename, etc.); with `{children}`, we are passing down the original contents.

The copying action is a little messy (because of cross-browser compatibility issues) – see the comment in `copyToClipboard()` function.

Styling is done using Tailwindcss. If you hate it, you can use a different way to style the markup. 

## 'Signal' that our component is really slick

Preact has recently [added a new api called *Signals*](https://preactjs.com/blog/introducing-signals/). This api is obviously inspired by [Solid's *Signals*](https://www.solidjs.com/guides/reactivity) – but it is even terser and more different from [React's Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html).

Let's try it! Firstly, we'll need to install a dedicated module (signals are not a part of the Preact's core library):

```bash
# Using NPM
npm install @preact/signals

# Using Yarn
yarn add @preact/signals
```

Then, we can use the signals add interactivity. It will be simple:

When clicked, our button will change its text to **"Copied!"**. After one second, it will return to the default **"Copy"**. To observe the "Copy" action, we'll use a signal, that will be updated after a timeout. We'll derive the button's current text with *computed signal*:

```jsx
import { createRef, ComponentChildren } from "preact";
import { signal, computed } from "@preact/signals";

const EnhancedPreElement = ({ children, ...props }: { children: ComponentChildren }) => {
  const snippetRef = createRef<HTMLPreElement>();
  const timeoutRef = createRef<ReturnType<typeof setTimeout>>();

  const hasBeenCopiedRecently = signal(false);

  const buttonText = computed(() => {
    return hasBeenCopiedRecently.value ? "Copied!" : "Copy";
  });

  const copyToClipboard = () => {
    let snippet = snippetRef.current;
    let area = document.createElement("textarea");
    area.value = snippet ? snippet.innerText : "";
    area.select();
    area.setSelectionRange(0, 99999);
    navigator.clipboard.writeText(area.value);
    hasBeenCopiedRecently.value = true;

    timeoutRef.current = setTimeout(() => {
      timeoutRef.current = null;
      hasBeenCopiedRecently.value = false;
    }, 1000);
  };

  return (
    <div className="relative group">
      <pre {...props} ref={snippetRef}>
        {children}
      </pre>
      <button
        className="text-sm text-gray-300 bg-gray-700 rounded absolute top-4 right-4 px-2 invisible group-hover:visible"
        onClick={() => {
          if (timeoutRef.current) {
            return false;
          } else {
            copyToClipboard();
          }
        }}
      >
        {buttonText}
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default EnhancedPreElement;
```

## Use the component in MDX

There are basically two options how to tell the MDX compiler that we want to render `<pre>` elements using our `EnhancedPreElement` component.

We can do it either in a MDX file, inline, like this:

```md
---
title: How to sum up two numbers in JavaScript
category: JavaScript
---
import EnhancedPreElement from "../components/EnhancedPreElement"
export const components = { pre: (props) => <EnhancedPreElement client:load {...props} />}

// The rest of the MDX file…
```

It's very similar as it was when using Next.js. The one very important difference is that you need to use the `client:load` (or other) directive to tell Astro when and how load the compiled script. Just try to omit it – the component won't load at all.

Alternatively, we can use Astro's template (layout) page, that will make the replacement globally, using the `<Content />` component:

```astro
---
import { Content, components } from '../some-mdx-file.mdx';
import EnhancedPreElement from '../components/EnhancedPreElement';
---
<Content components={{...components, pre: (props) => <EnhancedPreElement client:load {...props} /> }} />
```
