# The one React snippet I've always missed

## TLDR;

```json
"show data as preformatted JSON": {
    "prefix": "pson",
    "body": ["<pre>{JSON.stringify(${1:data}, null, 2)}</pre>"],
    "description": "Show data as JSON string in a <pre> tag"
  }
```

## The complete Why and How

Using React, I frequently run into a need to quickly inspect a nested data payload of unknown/uncertain shape.

Yes, I can definitely use `console.log(data)` and inspect it using devtools. But then I would need to use a mouse click to open every single subtree, which can be really tedious.

Most of the times, my best solution personally would be to create a `<pre>` element and inside this element, display a serialized JSON in a pretty format (`JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)`). If you'd omit the `<pre>` tag or the [third (space) parameter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify#parameters) of the serializing function, it wouldn't work (it would display the JSON string, but it wouldn't be formatted, thus probably completely unreadable).

Because I've been using this quite a lot, I was looking for a way to avoid typing it manually every single time. I tried to take advantage of emmet abbreviations, but for some reason (probably conflicting snippet packages),  expanding `pre` was giving me `private name() {}` and if I wanted to get to actual `<pre>` tag from intellisense, I have to scroll down the list five items down ðŸ¤”. So, I've come with my own snippet:

```json
"show data as preformatted JSON": {
    "prefix": "pson",
    "body": ["<pre>{JSON.stringify(${1:data}, null, 2)}</pre>"],
    "description": "Show data as JSON string in a <pre> tag"
  }
```
Expanding the snippet gives us this:

```jsx
<pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>
```

How to use it? Open Command Palette (Ctrl/Command+Shift+P), select Configure User Snippets, select the proper language file (`javascriptreact.json` or `typescritreact.json`), copy and past the snippet in the root object and save the file.

The "pson" abbreviation can be explained as "Pre tag containing jSON data" â€“ I find it memorable enough and if you don't like it, you can easily change it to whatever you like.

Enjoy!
