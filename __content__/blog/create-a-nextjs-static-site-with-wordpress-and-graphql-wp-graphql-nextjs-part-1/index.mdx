# Create a Next.js static site with Wordpress and GraphQL (WP GraphQL + Next.js, part 1)

In this tutorial, we will create a JAMstack app by connecting three quite different libraries. On the backend, there is the old champ WordPress, tuned up by [Roots](https://roots.io). On the frontend, there is the prodigy, [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). Between those two, there is a great invention from, erm… the minions? (*cough*): [GraphQL](https://graphql.org).

As it turned out, these three, despite being of different ages and speaking different languages, got along really well. Let's give it a try!

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that we have some experience with both WordPress and React (not necessarily Next.js). It also assumes that we have already installed [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) and that we have some kind of LAMP stack development environment (e. g. [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html), [Laragon](https://laragon.org/) or [Local](https://localwp.com/)) set up. We will also need to either create a new MySQL database for our WordPress project or use an existing one.

On the Next.js part, I will use [yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry) as a packet manager. While I was a longtime satisfied npm user, I switched to yarn because it was able to get around some nasty `node-gyp` issues. But feel free to use whatever packet manager you like (just update the commands accordingly).

## Why Bedrock?

[Bedrock](https://roots.io/bedrock/) is an open source boilerplate for WordPress development. It significantly improves the developer experience and makes WordPress development feel quite up to date. It fully leverages the advantages of Composer by making WordPress and its plugins *modules* that can be easily installed and updated from a command line. It also stores the configuration in separate `.env` files, which makes the configuration and version control much easier. The folder structure is also improved (user data like uploads are separated). After trying Bedrock, I definitely don't want to go back to "out of the box" WordPress.

## Install and Set up New WordPress/Bedrock Project

First, let's create a new Bedrock project:

```bash
composer create-project roots/bedrock
```

In our freshly created project root directory, there is an `.env` file. Unlike the 'vanilla' WordPress release, where the sensitive data are basically 'hardcoded' in the `config.php` file (which brings the problem of version control), Bedrock follows the 'modern' approach where the sensitive data are stored in the environmental variables. Let's open the file and update it with our database credentials. Also, unlike 'vanilla' WordPress, our site's base url is stored here as `WP_HOME` (which makes switching environments much smoother). Let's update it as well. Last but not least, it is definitely a good practice to generate the cryptographic salts, which are also stored in the `.env` file.

## Install the Plugins

After installing and setting up our project, let's open its root folder and install the **WP GraphQL** plugin, also using Composer. Let's open the `composer.json` file (it's in the root directory) and add `wpackagist-plugin/wp-graphql` to the list of dependencies (under `required`), like that:

```json lines=14
// composer.json

// ...
"require": {
  "php": ">=7.1",
  "composer/installers": "^1.12",
  "vlucas/phpdotenv": "^5.3",
  "oscarotero/env": "^2.1",
  "roots/bedrock-autoloader": "^1.0",
  "roots/bedrock-disallow-indexing": "^2.0",
  "roots/wordpress": "5.8.1",
  "roots/wp-config": "1.0.0",
  "roots/wp-password-bcrypt": "1.0.0",
  "wpackagist-plugin/wp-graphql": "^1.6"
},
// ...
```

After adding the WP GraphQL plugin to a list of dependencies in `composer.json`, we have to run the `update` command. Composer will download and install the plugin and all its dependencies:

```bash
composer update
```

Let's test if everything is working fine. Let's get started with our development environment. We need to point our server to a `web` subdirectory, which is a distinction from 'vanilla' release. The 'admin' urls are also slightly different—they are prefixed by `/wp/` segment, so `https://example.com/wp-login.php` is now `https://example.com/wp/wp-login.php`. This can cause some issues when importing an existing database and the rewrite rules do not match. I  was able to solve that issue by creating a `.htaccess` file with the [default rewrite rules](https://wordpress.org/support/article/htaccess/) and saving it to the `web` directory.

Hopefully, everything went well, and we successfully installed a new WordPress instance. Let's log in to our admin pages and activate the WP GraphQL plugin. A GraphQL link should appear in the sidebar, and a GraphiQL IDE link should appear on the upper bar:

<Image  src={import("./assets/wp-graphql-tutorial-pt1-admin-page-graphiql-edited.png")} alt="Image of the WordPress admin pages after activating WP GraphQL plugin"/>

Also, check the plugin settings (see image below). We didn't need to change any of the defaults. Just notice the 'GraphQL Endpoint' option, because we will need this later while querying the data from our Next app.

<Image src={import("./assets/wp-graphql-tutorial-pt1-admin-page-settings-full-edited.png")} alt="Image of the default WP GraphQL plugin settings"/>

One more thing: Right now, if we use a fresh new install with an empty database, there is barely any data to query (just the default "Hello World" post), which is kind of dull. Let's create more posts! We'll use the 'Faker Press' plugin.

```json lines=15
// composer.json

// ...
"require": {
  "php": ">=7.1",
  "composer/installers": "^1.12",
  "vlucas/phpdotenv": "^5.3",
  "oscarotero/env": "^2.1",
  "roots/bedrock-autoloader": "^1.0",
  "roots/bedrock-disallow-indexing": "^2.0",
  "roots/wordpress": "5.8.1",
  "roots/wp-config": "1.0.0",
  "roots/wp-password-bcrypt": "1.0.0",
  "wpackagist-plugin/wp-graphql": "^1.6",
  "wpackagist-plugin/fakerpress": "^0.5"
},
// ...
```

And we'll install the plugin the same way as the first one:

```bash
composer update
```

When the plugin is installed and activated, the 'FakerPress' menu item appears on the sidebar. Let's go to the 'posts' submenu and create some posts. I did create 12 posts for "this month", but feel free to change that settings.  I would only suggest making _some_ posts. 

<Image src={import("./assets/wp-graphql-tutorial-pt1-admin-page-fakerpress-posts.png")} alt="Image of the Faker Press settings" />

## Install Next.js

Now, that WordPress is set up, it is time to install Next.js. It really doesn't matter, _where_ we install it; it can be completely separated from WordPress. For the sake of simplicity, let's install it in the root directory of our project, so it will look like this:

```
wordpress-next-app/
  ├── bedrock/
  └── nextjs/
```

I would recommend already setting up a TypeScript project (by using the `--typescript` flag), even though we will use only plain Javascript in this tutorial and all possible TypeScript complaints will be silenced. The actual typing (especially the typing of GraphQL queries) will be the topic of the second part of our tutorial.

```bash
yarn create next-app --typescript
```

## Create a Basic Api

In our Next.js project we create a new directory, `lib`, and in this library, a new file, `api.js` (you can go straight for TypeScript and make it `api.ts`, but the compiler will likely complain about some `any` parameters—you can mute it for now using the `// @ts-nocheck` on the top of the file). This file will contain a function that we'll use for querying the graphql endpoint created by the WP GraphQL plugin.

```javascript
// lib/api.js

const API_URL = process.env.GRAPHQL_API_URL;

export async function fetchAPI(query, { variables } = {}) {
  const headers = { "Content-Type": "application/json" };

  const res = await fetch(API_URL, {
    method: "POST",
    headers,
    body: JSON.stringify({ query, variables }),
  });

  const json = await res.json();

  if (json.errors) {
    console.log(json.errors);
    console.log("error details", query, variables);
    throw new Error("Failed to fetch API");
  }
  return json.data;
}
```

Great, we have a fetcher function. Now, we need some actual queries. If you've worked with **GraphiQL IDE** before, you know that one of its cool features is the ability to construct a query by just checking the sidebar items. Our first query will select the title and slug of our posts:

```javascript
// lib/api.js

const API_URL = process.env.GRAPHQL_API_URL;

export async function fetchAPI(query, { variables } = {}) {
  // ...
}

// posts are 'latests' because by default WP GraphQL exposes the last 10 posts
export async function getLatestPostsLinks() {
  const data = await fetchAPI(`
    query LatestPostsLinks {
      posts {
        nodes {
          title
          slug
        }
      }
    }
  `);
  return data?.posts;
}
```

## Create a Home Page

While we have our first query prepared, we need to actually use it somewhere. Let's open the `index.tsx` file from a `/pages` folder. For the sake of simplicity, we'll delete the current content and replace it with a very straightforward example:

```tsx
// pages/index.tsx

const Home = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Our WordPress/Next app Home Page</h1>
    </div>
  );
};
```

Beautiful, isn't it? Well, probably not. Let's add some styles to make it look acceptable, at least. There are some useful open source CSS libraries for basic HTML element styling, such as [Basic.css](https://github.com/vladocar/Basic.css/blob/master/css/basic.css) and [spcss](https://github.com/susam/spcss/blob/master/sp.css). There is a `styles` folder in the root dir of our Next.js app, containing a `globals.css` file. Let's open it and replace all of its contents with one of the linked files from github. Last but not least, put a single remaining selector with a few rules taken from [58 bytes of css to look great nearly everywhere](https://jrl.ninja/etc/1/) article (NOTE: Unfortunately, the link seems to be currently broken):

```css
/* ... Basic.css rules */

#__next {
  max-width: 70ch;
  padding: 2ch;
  margin: auto;
}
```

So where were we? All right, the query. We will use the `getStaticProps` function, which is quite versatile and works not only for static sites generation (SSG), but for client and server side rendering (CSR/SSR) as well. The get static props will call our prepared fetcher function to get the data. For now, we will utilize the `JSON.stringify()` method to display the actual data.

```tsx
// pages/index.tsx 

import { getLatestPostsLinks } from "./../lib/api";

const Home = ({ latestPosts } = {}) => {
  const { nodes } = latestPosts;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Our WordPress/Next app Home Page</h1>
      <pre>{JSON.stringify(nodes, null, 2)}</pre>
    </div>
  );
};

export async function getStaticProps() {
  const latestPosts = await getLatestPostsLinks();

  return {
    props: {
      latestPosts,
    },
  };
}

export default Home;
```

Those of us who are using TypeScript may notice a complaint about an unclear prop type. For now, just tell TypeScript to ignore the file using `@ts-nocheck` directive. We will add typing later—in the second part of this tutorial.

```tsx
// pages/index.tsx

// @ts-nocheck
import { getLatestPostsLinks } from "./../lib/api";

const Home = ({ latestPosts } = {}) => {
  //...
};

//...
```

## Try our api

All right! For now, first check if the WordPress environment is running. You can do a simple test of the GraphQL endpoint by simply trying to visit its url (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1/wp/graphql`). You should get a page with a JSON object containing an error caused by missing arguments, like that:

```
{"errors":[{"message":"GraphQL Request must include at least one of those two parameters: \"query\" or \"queryId\"","extensions":{"category":"request"}}],"extensions":{"debug":[{"type":"DEBUG_LOGS_INACTIVE","message":"GraphQL Debug logging is not active. To see debug logs, GRAPHQL_DEBUG must be enabled."}]}}
```

But this is totally expected, and it actually means that everything on the WordPress side is working fine. So let's start our Next.js dev server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Hopefully, we can see our first query result:

<Image src={import("./assets/wp-graphql-tutorial-pt1-first-query-display.png")} alt="Image of the homepage with our first queried data" />

It doesn't look bad, but we want *actual links*, no just a JSON list of them. Let's import a `Link` component and create some… no surprise, links:

```tsx
// pages/index.tsx

// @ts-nocheck
import Link from "next/link";

import { getLatestPostsLinks } from "./../lib/api";

const Home = ({ latestPosts } = {}) => {
  const { nodes } = latestPosts;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Our WordPress/Next app Home Page</h1>
      <ul>
        {nodes.map((node) => (
          <div key={node.slug}>
            <Link href={"posts/" + node.slug}>{node.title}</Link>
          </div>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

export async function getStaticProps() {
  const latestPosts = await getLatestPostsLinks();

  return {
    props: {
      latestPosts,
    },
  };
}

export default Home;
```

Now we should see a page with a list of links to our posts. But clicking any of these links gives us a 404 error page. We need to create a template for displaying our posts.

## Create a Post template

Let's create a `/posts` subfolder under `/pages` directory. In that directory, create a `[slug].tsx` file.

```
nextjs/
  ├── pages/
  │   ├── posts/
  │   │   ├──[slug].tsx
```

The `slug` inside brackets can be seen as a variable, a prop, that will be eventually replaced with an actual value. To do that, we will use another function from Next.js, `getStaticPaths`.

We've added a new function to our api, that will query all posts that have a slug. It is very similar to our first query, but we specify a quite high exact number of queried items (WP GraphQL is quite restrictive about a large amount of data queried at once to prevent "server meltdowns"):

```tsx
// lib/api.js

const API_URL = "http://127.0.0.1/wp/graphql";

export async function fetchAPI(query, { variables } = {}) {
  // ...
}

export async function getLatestPostsLinks() {
  const data = await fetchAPI(`
    query LatestPostsLinks {
      posts {
        nodes {
          title
          slug
        }
      }
    }
  `);
  return data?.posts;
}

export async function getAllPostsWithSlug() {
  const data = await fetchAPI(`
    query AllPostsWithSlug {
      posts(first: 100) {
        nodes {
          slug
        }
      }
    }
  `);
  return data?.posts;
}
```

Now, let's create a template for our post. For now, the post itself will be shown as a JSON string (we will improve that soon). The `getStaticProps` function is very similar to that that we used before; it is just calling a different fetching function with a distinct query (see above ☝).

What is new here is the `getStaticPaths` function. What does it do? It builds a list of *paths* (or relative urls, if you wish) that will point to our new `Post` template. It also utilizes a fetcher function, which gets the post nodes with slugs. Then, we simply map over the nodes and construct the paths:

```tsx
// pages/posts/[slug].tsx

// @ts-nocheck
import { getAllPostsWithSlug, getPost } from "../../lib/api";

const Post = ({ post }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <pre>{JSON.stringify(post, null, 2)}</pre>
    </div>
  );
};

export async function getStaticProps(context) {
  const { slug } = context.params;
  const post = await getPost(slug);
  return {
    props: {
      post,
    },
  };
}

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const allPostsWithSlug = await getAllPostsWithSlug();
  return {
    paths: allPostsWithSlug.nodes.map((node) => `/posts/${node.slug}`) || [],
    fallback: false,
  };
}

export default Post;
```

Hopefully, we can see our post—but only as a JSON string. Let's make it pretty, and let's add a link to a homepage so we can browse our posts easily:

```tsx
// pages/posts/[slug].tsx

// @ts-nocheck
import Link from "next/link";

import { getAllPostsWithSlug, getPost } from "../../lib/api";

const Post = ({ post }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Link href="/">Back to Homepage</Link>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <time dateTime={post.date}>{new Date(post.date).toDateString()}</time>
      <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: post.content }}></div>
    </div>
  );
};

export async function getStaticProps(context) {
  // ...
}

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  // ...
}

export default Post;
```

## Generate a static site

Great job! Now, let's leverage the Next.js SSG feature and make our site statically generated and super fast. First, let's install a simple http server made by creators of Next.js, [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) (this is optional; you can use any server of your choice, or install it on-demand using npx, but then you'll need to properly modify the following scripts).

```bash
yarn global add serve
```

When the *serve* is installed, let's open the `package.json` file and add two scripts (this is optional; if you are a UNIX-based shell user, you can run them directly):

```json
// package.json

// ...
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "lint": "next lint",
	  "export": "next build && next export",
    "static": "next build && next export && cd out && start http://localhost:5000 && serve -p 5000"
  },
  // ...
```

The `export` script combines the `build` script (which creates a production build that can be server-side rendered) and the `export` script (which takes the production build and creates a fully static site out of it). The `static` command adds three more steps: it navigates to the `/out` directory, where the static build is located; it opens the default browser on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) and it starts the http server pointing to that port.

Let's try it:

```bash
yarn static
```

Now, hopefully, our fully static, _blazingly fast_ site is running at `http://localhost:5000`.

## What's next?

If you are in the mood, you can try to enhance this project by yourself, e.g.:

- by creating a collection of WordPress *pages*, a `[slug].tsx` template for them, and linking them on the homepage,
- by adding a new menu to the homepage after creating one in the WordPress admin pages.

This tutorial has a [second part](https://github.com/HynekS/wp-next-graphql-tutorial/tree/part-02), where we will learn how to add auto-generated types to our queries and use them in our templates.

👍 Enjoy!
