# Get exact string length in TypeScript

How can we get a length of a string using TypeScript? Well, every string has a `length` property, hasn't it? And we can access it in TypeScript using the bracket notation. Let's try!

```ts
const myString = "marshmallow"

type Strlen<S extends string> = S["length"];

type MyStrlen = Strlen<myString> // "number" ü§î
```

Sadly it doesn't work the way we wanted. We got `number` type. Technically, there's nothing wrong with that ‚Äì the type of string length *is* a `number`. But what about the *exact* one?

Hmmm‚Ä¶

What about arrays? Can TypeScript get exact length of an array?

```ts
const myArray = ["chocolate", "liquorice", "marshmallow"]

type Arrlen<A extends unknown[]> = A["length"]

type MyArrlen<typeof myArray> // "number" ü§î
```

Still no success? Well, TypeScript actually can't get the exact length of an array. The only data structure it *can* get length of is a **tuple**, a list-like data structure with a fixed length. Ironically, JavaScript currently doesn't have a tuple data structure, but TypeScript kind of does.

```ts
const myTuple = ["chocolate", "liquorice", "marshmallow"] as const
/*
or myTuple: readonly string[] = ["chocolate", "liquorice", "marshmallow"]
or myTuple = ReadonlyArray<string> = ["chocolate", "liquorice", "marshmallow"]
*/

type Arrlen<A extends readonly unknown[]> = A["length"]

type MyArrlen<typeof myArray> // 3 üéâ
```

Using type assertion (`as const`, `readonly`) would be common in practice, but there is an even simpler way to do this ‚Äì and it is important to show, because otherwise you might be confused why the final code actually doesn't use type assertion:

```ts
type Arrlen<A extends unknown[]> = A["length"] // no readonly!

type MyArrlen<["chocolate", "liquorice", "marshmallow"]> // 3 üéâ
```

As we can see, if we use a type literal, TypeScript regards it as a tuple by default.

So we can get a length of a string, if we convert it somehow to a tuple of the same length. Is this possible? Good news ‚Äì it is!

This might get a little scary for someone, but there is nothing too arcane, just a simple tail-call recursion, which is a substitute for a loop {TypeScript does't have loops).

First, let's create equivalent JavaScript function:

```js
function strlen(str, cache = []) {
  const first = str.slice(0, 1);
  const rest = str.slice(1);
  // the TS version is closer to `let [first, ...rest] = str`,
  // but it breaks in JS once `...rest` gets `undefined` (which is not iterable)
  
  return first.length 
    ? strlen(rest, [...cache, first]) 
    : cache.length;
}

console.log(strlen("marshmallow")) // 11 üéâ
```
This is of course kind of ridiculous, because we can do simply `"marshmallow".length` in JavaScript. But as has been said before, it doesn't work the same way in TypeScript.

This is the TypeScript version of the strlen: 

```ts
type Strlen<
  Str extends string,
  Cache extends string[] = []
> = Str extends `${infer First}${infer Rest}`
  ? Strlen<Rest, [...Cache, First]>
  : Cache["length"]

type MyStrlen = Strlen<"marshmallow"> // 11 üéâ
```

Heureka, we have our exact length!

Confused about what's going on here? We're recursively iterating over a string. At each iteration, we pull out the first character (using `infer`) and add it to a `Cache` tuple. Once we are done iterating, we return the length of the `Cache` tuple.

üëç Enjoy!
