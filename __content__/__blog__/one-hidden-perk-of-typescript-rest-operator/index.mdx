# Get type of the first and the last tuple element in TypeScript 


```ts
type First<T extends readonly any[]> = T extends readonly [infer R, ...any[]] ? R : never
```

```ts
type First<T extends readonly any[]> = T extends readonly [infer R, ...any] ? R : never
type Last<T extends readonly any[]> = T extends readonly [...any, infer R] ? R : never

const test = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] as const

type TestFirst = First<typeof test> // 1
type TestLast = Last<typeof test> // 5
```
