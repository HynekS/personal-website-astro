## Comment

This was initially a simple WordPress site with a slightly modified default theme. During the "JAMstack rush" I migrated it to a static site with Gatsby on frontend and Netlify CMS on backend. The site was O.K., but the client was struggling a little with the CMS UI, thus I decided to migrate it to Sanity (which I have used in the past and is slightly more user friendly). Because Gatsby has silently passed away in the meantime, I decided to move to Next.js. I also ditched SSG in the favor of SSR.

One thing I wasn't happy about is the frontend to backend type safety. It is not officialy supported yet when for GROQ queries (it might work better with GraphQL). There are some promising open source projects working on solution (EXAMPLES), but they are still in development and I wasn't able to make them really work. In the end, I've just use the codegen (MORE) and wrote the types for API responses by hand, which is quite _meh_, but for a small project like this probably acceptable.

In general, migrating from Gatsby to Next.js went smooth. The result is much cleaner (which is probably due to the fact that I have more experience with Next then I have with Gatsby when building the previous version). The only thing I've struggled a little was the different API's, mainly for media.

The site is being deployed with Vercel, so I have CI for free. As in my other projects, I am using Preact instead of React for smaller bundles on production.
