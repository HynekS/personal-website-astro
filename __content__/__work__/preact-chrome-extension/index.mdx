### Comment

The injected script adds a little Preact component to each element which is considered "blockable" â€“ review, comment etc. The component consists of a simple collapsible menu (inspired by Twitter) that allows add/remove users from a blocklist, show/hide blocked posts etc. Blocking can be also done using the extension popup.

All the business logic is contained in the extension's background script (service worker). The shared state is managed with a super simple[react-hooks-global-state](https://github.com/dai-shi/react-hooks-global-state) library from  [Daishi](https://twitter.com/dai_shi), the creator of [Jotai](https://jotai.org/), which also guarantees reactivity.

Styling is done using Tailwind and SASS.
