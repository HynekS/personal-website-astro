## Comment

Classic client side SPA. This project is build on top of React. The codebase was initially written in JavaScript, but I've earlier migrated it to TypeScript. State management is done by redux (I've lately migrated from vanilla redux to redux toolkit.

The code is being pretty aggressively code-splitted. For a production build, React is being aliased to Preact, which results in a much smaller bundle size.

Styling is being done using Tailwindcss via twin.macro.
